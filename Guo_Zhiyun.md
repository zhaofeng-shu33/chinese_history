# About the descendent of Guo Zhiyun
Guo Zhiyun was a military officer of Dynasty Tang.
It is a mystery how many children Guo had since there are inconsistencies between
different records of history. According to Ouyang Xiu, Su ting (蘇頲)
had also written one epitaph for Guo Zhiyun but his writing does not
exist any more according to 全唐文 and the evidential study of 陈耀东.

The controversy starts when only two sons were recorded in 舊唐書 but four sons
were recorded in the two epitaphs. Some modern scholars like 王颜 suspect that
there was some name changing for at least one of his son.
According to the analysis of 欧阳修, the other three sons did not achieve much 
and they were not recorded in the history records. On the other hand, according
to the analysis in 金石錄, 英乂 was too young to be mentioned in the epitaph.
